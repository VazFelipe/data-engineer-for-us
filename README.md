## What is this all about?

- Hi, I am **Felipe Vaz**, a Data Engineer that starts a carrer in data analysis in 2010. In that age I realize that I am a person who is **experienced in interviewing, capturing and translating** business requirements into data ideas and solutions. 
- The idea behind this repo is to **write about** Data Engineering Lifecycle, practice english skills and share all the data engineer stuff that I am doing in my notepad.
- **Follow me** on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vazfelipe/?locale=en_US).
